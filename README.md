This code has the **updated** resources you need for the codelab [Building an augmented reality application with the WebXR Device API](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/#0). You can follow the updated steps from the list below:

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/arnaudhambenne/ar-with-webxr/blob/master/1_INTRODUCTION.md)
2. [Getting set up](https://github.com/arnaudhambenne/ar-with-webxr/blob/master/2_GETTING_SET_UP.md)
3. [State of AR on the web](https://github.com/arnaudhambenne/ar-with-webxr/blob/master/3_STATE_OF_AR_ON_THE_WEB.md)
4. Overview of our AR app
5. Add a cube to a surface
6. Use a 3D model from Poly
7. Add Shadows
8. Extra Credit and Additional Resources

Until the above list of steps have been fully updated with working links, consider this repo a work in progress.


## What you'll learn

* How to use the WebXR Device API
* How to find a surface using augmented reality hit tests
* How to load and render a 3D model synchronized with the real world camera feed

## What you'll need

* A workstation for coding and hosting static web content
* [ARCore-capable Android device](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices) running at least [Android 8.0 Oreo](https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/)
